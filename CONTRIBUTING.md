# Contributing to django-ninja-search

Thank you for considering contributing to `django-ninja-search`! ðŸŽ‰

This guide will help you get started.

---

## ðŸš§ Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Django >=5.1.0
* [Django Ninja](https://django-ninja.dev)
* Poetry (for dependency management)

---

## ðŸ“¦ Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anandrnair547/django-ninja-search.git
cd django-ninja-search
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
poetry install
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

Install devâ€‘dependencies first (they include **pytest-cov** for coverage reports):

```bash
poetry install  # pulls dev group too
```

Run the full test suite with coverage (targeting the `ninja_search` module) and generate an HTML report:

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=ninja_search --cov-report=html
```

This creates `htmlcov/index.html` â€” open it to view detailed coverage:

```bash
open htmlcov/index.html  # macOS
# or
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # Linux
```

---

## âœ… Guidelines

* Follow PEP8 and Black formatting.
* Write clear commit messages.
* Cover new functionality with tests.
* If your feature is Ninja-specific (e.g. depends on `Schema` or `Query`), document that in your PR.

---

## ðŸ§  Tips

* The decorator is meant for Django Ninja views using `Schema` and `Query`.
* Refer to existing usage in `tests/unit/test_searching.py` for patterns.
